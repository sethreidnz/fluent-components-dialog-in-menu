# @fluent/react-component Dialog within a Menu issue

This repository demonstrates what seems to be a bug where if you nest a dialog trigger within a menu you it doesn't work.

## Getting started

Run the following:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

This will run the app and you will see a page with just a single menu with item to open the dialog.
